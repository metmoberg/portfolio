    <h3>UI / UX Experience</h3>
    <h5>I've done UI / UX design related work during my studies and then also been part of a website creation process during my internship.</h5>
    <h4>UI Design project for HSL (Helsingin Seudun Liikenne) (only in Finnish unfortunately)</h4>
    <h5>We saw issues with the HSL app & website and decided to take on the project on finding more user friendly solutions for them. We interviewed different aged students and tried to make alternative solutions for the website and app to make them work more like the people would prefer. </h5>
    <aside id="ux1">

    <h4>User research plan for the project</h4>
    <h5>Simply stating the basic information about the project, the research questions,</h5>
    <h5>how we collect, protect & analyze data and who will be the participants.</h5>

        <h4>Website layout plan made for the project.</h4>
        <h5>I was in charge of making the prototype for the website. Currently you can't purchase the tickets online which is an issue because if the app doesn't work, you can't purchase the tickets or show your already purchased ticket. The website appearance was inspired by how the app looks like.</h5>

        <h4>Information Architecture</h4>
        <h5>During my internship, I did IA for a few pages on the company's new website. I did the IA while following the wireframes of other pages and user stories.</h5>
